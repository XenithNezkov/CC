## Developer's checklist
<!--
Just a reminder to keep up the best practices, and to ensure that everyone has an easier time as a result! Please doublecheck that they were done!
-->
- [ ] Try to modularize as much as possible. <!--  Do this by putting stuff in the modular caustic folder, and modifying Azure code by calling your code from the places where you could put the code, for an example-->
- [ ] Mark the start and end of edits outside the caustic modular folder (if applicable) for changes made.
<!--
Do this one like so

Azure
///Caustic edit
Your code
///Caustic edit end
Azure

This makes it easier for maintainers to keep track of what's ours.
-->
- [ ] Ensure that it compiles locally, and test new features (when applicable, please record if not!), or potential issues with related features.

## Testing Evidence
